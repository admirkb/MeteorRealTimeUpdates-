# MeteorRealTimeUpdates-

The packages folder refused to publish from visual studio. I renamed to packagesRenamed just to force it to upload.
When you download remember to change this back else meteor will not be able to find required packages.
If anyone knows why this happens please let me know at kelvin@admir.tv
